[ ] 11 Phase 11 - Recovery Replay and Hardening Loop
  Implement post-release hardening priorities for reconnect, replay, retry, and observability resilience.

  [x] 11.1 Section - Session Resume Loop Containment
    Implement idempotent reconnect behavior so repeated disconnects do not amplify command replay.

    [x] 11.1.1 Task - Implement reconnect dedupe and resume-topic continuity
      Ensure reconnect behavior remains stable during repeated disconnect notifications.

      [x] 11.1.1.1 Subtask - Implement reconnect-command dedupe for identical session resume topics.
      [x] 11.1.1.2 Subtask - Implement deterministic reconnect notices for deduped vs emitted commands.
      [x] 11.1.1.3 Subtask - Implement reconnect history markers that capture dedupe decisions.

    [x] 11.1.2 Task - Implement reconnect loop verification coverage
      Validate repeated disconnect handling without duplicate join command growth.

      [x] 11.1.2.1 Subtask - Verify repeated disconnects keep one pending join command per resume topic.
      [x] 11.1.2.2 Subtask - Verify reconnect-attempt counters still increment under deduped loops.
      [x] 11.1.2.3 Subtask - Verify reconnect notices remain deterministic across repeated events.

  [x] 11.2 Section - Retry Storm Containment and Backoff Semantics
    Implement bounded retry behavior with deterministic backoff and explicit exhaustion handling.

    [x] 11.2.1 Task - Implement deterministic retry backoff schedule
      Ensure retry transitions emit predictable timing state for UI/runtime coordination.

      [x] 11.2.1.1 Subtask - Implement retry attempt counters independent from workflow attempt counters.
      [x] 11.2.1.2 Subtask - Implement deterministic backoff progression for successive retry requests.
      [x] 11.2.1.3 Subtask - Implement runtime model state fields exposing active retry backoff.

    [x] 11.2.2 Task - Implement retry exhaustion and cancel reset behavior
      Prevent unbounded retry loops while preserving user-driven cancellation controls.

      [x] 11.2.2.1 Subtask - Implement maximum retry-attempt enforcement with typed exhaustion errors.
      [x] 11.2.2.2 Subtask - Implement cancel-flow reset of retry counters and backoff state.
      [x] 11.2.2.3 Subtask - Implement deterministic notices for retry requested, exhausted, and cancelled states.

  [ ] 11.3 Section - Observability Joinability Resilience
    Implement diagnostics that preserve joinability context when metrics are rejected.

    [ ] 11.3.1 Task - Implement metric-rejection joinability context payloads
      Ensure observability rejection events carry explicit correlation/request continuity metadata.

      [ ] 11.3.1.1 Subtask - Implement rejection payload fields for correlation/request identifiers.
      [ ] 11.3.1.2 Subtask - Implement deterministic rejection details for metric-name and error-code triage.
      [ ] 11.3.1.3 Subtask - Implement tests asserting joinability context continuity on rejection events.

    [ ] 11.3.2 Task - Implement metric-rejection flow resilience
      Ensure transport and runtime handling continue even when metric emission rejects a record.

      [ ] 11.3.2.1 Subtask - Implement rejection-path assertions that channel responses remain typed/deterministic.
      [ ] 11.3.2.2 Subtask - Implement observability event validation for rejection-path envelopes.
      [ ] 11.3.2.3 Subtask - Implement regression checks for missing-context observability failures.

  [ ] 11.4 Section - Phase 11 Integration Tests
    Validate reconnect/retry hardening and observability resilience scenarios end-to-end.

    [ ] 11.4.1 Task - Recovery replay and retry conformance scenarios
      Verify deterministic reconnect and bounded retry behavior through conformance scenarios.

      [ ] 11.4.1.1 Subtask - Verify `SCN-013` reconnect loop idempotency and resume-topic continuity.
      [ ] 11.4.1.2 Subtask - Verify `SCN-014` retry storm containment and deterministic backoff progression.
      [ ] 11.4.1.3 Subtask - Verify `SCN-016` timeout/retry/cancel chains reach deterministic terminal UI states.

    [ ] 11.4.2 Task - Observability resilience conformance scenarios
      Verify metric rejection behavior preserves diagnostics and does not break runtime flow.

      [ ] 11.4.2.1 Subtask - Verify `SCN-015` metric rejection events preserve correlation joinability context.
      [ ] 11.4.2.2 Subtask - Verify `SCN-015` rejection-path envelopes validate against runtime event schema.
      [ ] 11.4.2.3 Subtask - Verify `SCN-015` rejection paths do not prevent canonical channel outcomes.
