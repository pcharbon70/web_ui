- `specs/conformance/spec_conformance_matrix.md`

## Relevant Assumptions / Defaults
- UI widget bursts must preserve stable command ordering and replay continuity.
- CloudEvent envelopes must remain typed and deterministic under repeated dispatch.
- Conformance scenarios must cover ordering guarantees at runtime and transport boundaries.

[ ] 12 Phase 12 - Burst Dispatch Ordering and Replay Fidelity
  Implement deterministic burst-order dispatch semantics and conformance coverage for multi-event widget interaction bursts.

  [x] 12.1 Section - UI Dispatch Sequence Baseline
    Implement explicit sequence numbering on outbound widget events.

    [x] 12.1.1 Task - Implement sequence-state tracking in UI model and runtime update path
      Ensure each accepted widget dispatch increments a deterministic sequence counter.

      [x] 12.1.1.1 Subtask - Implement default `dispatch_sequence` state initialization.
      [x] 12.1.1.2 Subtask - Implement outbound event data enrichment with `dispatch_sequence`.
      [x] 12.1.1.3 Subtask - Implement runtime tests validating monotonic sequence order across burst dispatches.

  [x] 12.2 Section - Replay Sequence Continuity
    Ensure retry and recovery paths preserve sequence identity for replayed commands.

    [x] 12.2.1 Task - Implement replay command continuity guarantees
      Prevent replay paths from mutating already-assigned dispatch ordering metadata.

      [x] 12.2.1.1 Subtask - Implement checks ensuring retry command replay retains original `dispatch_sequence`.
      [x] 12.2.1.2 Subtask - Implement deterministic replay notices for sequence-aware debugging.
      [x] 12.2.1.3 Subtask - Implement focused runtime recovery tests for replay sequence continuity.

  [x] 12.3 Section - Burst Ordering Spec and Scenario Mapping
    Register burst ordering requirements in conformance scenario docs and matrix mappings.

    [x] 12.3.1 Task - Implement scenario catalog and matrix updates for burst ordering
      Add canonical conformance IDs and contract mapping for ordering guarantees.

      [x] 12.3.1.1 Subtask - Implement `SCN-017` scenario-catalog entry for burst ordering.
      [x] 12.3.1.2 Subtask - Implement conformance matrix coverage for `SCN-017`.
      [x] 12.3.1.3 Subtask - Implement phase-specific conformance scenario document for phase 12.

  [ ] 12.4 Section - Phase 12 Integration Tests
    Validate burst ordering and replay fidelity across UI runtime and channel boundaries.

    [ ] 12.4.1 Task - Burst dispatch ordering conformance scenarios
      Verify burst interaction order survives runtime/transport boundaries.

      [ ] 12.4.1.1 Subtask - Verify `SCN-017` emits monotonic dispatch sequence under burst interactions.
      [ ] 12.4.1.2 Subtask - Verify `SCN-017` responses preserve dispatch ordering end-to-end.
      [ ] 12.4.1.3 Subtask - Verify `SCN-017` replay paths preserve original dispatch sequence values.
