# WebUi Architecture Execution Plan Index

This directory contains a phased implementation plan for executing the current `web_ui` architecture and governance baseline.

The plan aligns to:
- `specs/topology.md`
- `specs/design.md`
- `specs/contracts/*`
- `specs/events/*`
- `specs/conformance/*`
- `rfcs/*`

9. [Phase 9 - RFC Intake and Spec Governance Operations](./phase-09-rfc-intake-and-spec-governance-operations.md): operationalize RFC authoring, governance validation, and spec generation workflows.
10. [Phase 10 - First Implemented Slice and Release Readiness](./phase-10-first-implemented-slice-and-release-readiness.md): ship a first end-to-end slice with release gates and production-readiness checks.
11. [Phase 11 - Recovery Replay and Hardening Loop](./phase-11-recovery-replay-and-hardening-loop.md): harden reconnect/retry determinism and observability joinability under failure loops.
12. [Phase 12 - Burst Dispatch Ordering and Replay Fidelity](./phase-12-burst-dispatch-ordering-and-replay-fidelity.md): enforce deterministic ordering for widget burst dispatch and preserve replay sequence integrity.
13. [Phase 13 - Outcome Envelope Hints and UI Reconciliation](./phase-13-outcome-envelope-hints-and-ui-reconciliation.md): expand runtime outcome envelopes with typed UI hints and deterministic reconciliation behavior.
14. [Phase 14 - Release Gate Regression Hardening](./phase-14-release-gate-regression-hardening.md): prevent release-gate false positives/false negatives with deterministic stage markers and regression probes.
15. [Phase 15 - Session Resume Continuity and Replay Semantics](./phase-15-session-resume-continuity-and-replay-semantics.md): enforce resume cursor continuity and deterministic resume acknowledgements across reconnect/replay flows.
16. [Phase 16 - Unified IUR Interpretation and Signal Mapping](./phase-16-unified-iur-interpretation-and-signal-mapping.md): interpret Unified-IUR layout trees and signal hooks into deterministic runtime/event descriptors.
17. [Phase 17 - Policy Authorization and Dispatch Guards](./phase-17-policy-authorization-and-dispatch-guards.md): gate runtime dispatch with deterministic policy authorization checks and fail-closed outcomes.
18. [Phase 18 - Turn Execution Determinism and State Reconciliation](./phase-18-turn-execution-determinism-and-state-reconciliation.md): propagate deterministic turn IDs through dispatch and reconcile turn completion state across runtime outcomes.
19. [Phase 19 - Scope Resolution and Context Propagation](./phase-19-scope-resolution-and-context-propagation.md): resolve and propagate deterministic scope metadata through runtime dispatch with fail-closed scope-policy checks.
20. [Phase 20 - Persistence Replay Determinism and Checkpointing](./phase-20-persistence-replay-determinism-and-checkpointing.md): track deterministic replay cursors/checkpoints across dispatch and reconciliation flows.
21. [Phase 21 - Replay Retention and Export Controls](./phase-21-replay-retention-and-export-controls.md): provide deterministic replay snapshot/export and retention controls for runtime recovery diagnostics.

## Shared Conventions
- Numbering:
  - Phases: `N`
  - Sections: `N.M`
  - Tasks: `N.M.K`
  - Subtasks: `N.M.K.L`
- Tracking:
  - Every phase, section, task, and subtask uses Markdown checkboxes (`[ ]`).
- Description requirement:
  - Every phase, section, and task starts with a short description paragraph.
- Integration-test requirement:
  - Each phase ends with a final integration-testing section.

## Shared Assumptions and Defaults
- `WebUi.*` naming is canonical for runtime modules.
- CloudEvents-shaped envelopes are the canonical transport payload.
- Runtime/domain state authority remains server-side.
- Elm is the canonical deterministic UI runtime.
- Widget baseline parity with `term_ui` is normative for built-ins.
- Governance and conformance docs are mandatory before merge.
