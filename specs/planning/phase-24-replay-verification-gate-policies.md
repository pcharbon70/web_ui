## Relevant Shared APIs / Interfaces
- `specs/contracts/persistence_replay_contract.md`
- `specs/contracts/service_contract.md`
- `specs/conformance/spec_conformance_matrix.md`

## Relevant Assumptions / Defaults
- Replay verification gate policies evaluate diagnostics only and do not alter domain authority semantics.
- Gate pass/fail decisions must be deterministic for equivalent replay logs, exports, and policy inputs.
- Invalid gate policy inputs must fail closed with typed validation errors.

[ ] 24 Phase 24 - Replay Verification Gate Policies
  Add deterministic replay verification gate controls that classify verification outcomes as pass/fail under explicit policy.

  [x] 24.1 Section - Replay Verification Gate Primitives
    Extend replay-log helpers with deterministic gate-policy evaluation for replay verification outputs.

    [x] 24.1.1 Task - Implement replay verification gate APIs
      Provide typed helper APIs to evaluate verification match/drift results against explicit pass/fail policy thresholds.

      [x] 24.1.1.1 Subtask - Implement `ReplayLog.gate_export/3` with deterministic pass/fail reason summaries.
      [x] 24.1.1.2 Subtask - Implement verification policy normalization and fail-closed validation behavior.
      [x] 24.1.1.3 Subtask - Implement replay-log unit tests for strict and relaxed gate policy paths.

  [x] 24.2 Section - Runtime Verification Gate Integration
    Integrate replay verification gate controls into runtime message handling.

    [x] 24.2.1 Task - Implement replay verification gate runtime flow
      Accept typed replay gate requests and persist deterministic gate diagnostics in recovery state.

      [x] 24.2.1.1 Subtask - Implement runtime replay verification gate request handling.
      [x] 24.2.1.2 Subtask - Implement deterministic recovery diagnostics for gate pass/fail outcomes.
      [x] 24.2.1.3 Subtask - Implement runtime tests for replay verification gate behavior.

  [x] 24.3 Section - Scenario and Matrix Mapping
    Register replay verification gate continuity in conformance coverage.

    [x] 24.3.1 Task - Implement conformance mappings for replay gate continuity
      Add canonical scenario coverage for replay verification gate policy evaluation and deterministic reason diagnostics.

      [x] 24.3.1.1 Subtask - Implement `SCN-029` scenario-catalog entry for replay verification gate continuity.
      [x] 24.3.1.2 Subtask - Implement matrix updates linking `SCN-029` to persistence replay requirement families.
      [x] 24.3.1.3 Subtask - Implement phase-specific conformance scenario document for phase 24.

  [ ] 24.4 Section - Phase 24 Integration Tests
    Validate replay verification gate behavior through conformance-tagged runtime flows.

    [ ] 24.4.1 Task - Replay verification gate conformance scenarios
      Verify deterministic gate pass summaries, fail reason stability, and equivalent-flow gate trace continuity.

      [ ] 24.4.1.1 Subtask - Verify `SCN-029` equivalent replay verification inputs produce deterministic gate pass diagnostics.
      [ ] 24.4.1.2 Subtask - Verify `SCN-029` drift verification paths produce deterministic gate fail reason sets.
      [ ] 24.4.1.3 Subtask - Verify `SCN-029` repeated equivalent gate evaluations produce equivalent gate traces.
