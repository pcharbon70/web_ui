# Phase 7 - Observability and Correlation Baseline

Back to index: [README](./README.md)

## Relevant Shared APIs / Interfaces
- `RuntimeEventEnvelope`
- Observability metric families in `observability_contract.md`
- `WebUi.Channel` event emission hooks
- Widget and registry lifecycle event hooks

## Relevant Assumptions / Defaults
- Observability contract requirements are mandatory, not optional.
- Event streams and metric streams must be joinable by correlation identifiers.
- High-cardinality data is forbidden in metric labels.

      Capture connection lifecycle and operation-level throughput/latency metrics.

      [x] 7.2.1.1 Subtask - Implement websocket connection and disconnect counters.
      [x] 7.2.1.2 Subtask - Implement ingress/egress event counters by service/event/outcome.
      [x] 7.2.1.3 Subtask - Implement service operation latency histogram by service/operation/outcome.

    [x] 7.2.2 Task - Implement encode/decode and interop failure metrics
      Capture protocol decode/encode failures and extension interop errors.

      [x] 7.2.2.1 Subtask - Implement event decode and encode error counters by stable error code.
      [x] 7.2.2.2 Subtask - Implement JS interop error counters by bridge and stable error code.
      [x] 7.2.2.3 Subtask - Implement label-policy checks preventing unbounded high-cardinality labels.

  [ ] 7.3 Section - Correlation Joinability and Diagnostic Readiness
    Implement guaranteed joinability across events and metrics for debugging and governance audits.

    [ ] 7.3.1 Task - Implement correlation propagation for all observability surfaces
      Ensure event and metric records share stable join keys where required.

      [ ] 7.3.1.1 Subtask - Implement correlation propagation across transport and runtime emissions.
      [ ] 7.3.1.2 Subtask - Implement request-level continuity through widget and custom extension flows.
      [ ] 7.3.1.3 Subtask - Implement joinability checks in development diagnostics.

    [ ] 7.3.2 Task - Implement denied-path diagnostics and policy observability
      Ensure denied-paths emit explicit diagnostics without leaking sensitive payload details.

      [ ] 7.3.2.1 Subtask - Implement denied validation/policy event envelopes with typed outcomes.
      [ ] 7.3.2.2 Subtask - Implement policy-safe payload redaction for telemetry.
      [ ] 7.3.2.3 Subtask - Implement operator-facing guidance for interpreting denied-path diagnostics.

  [ ] 7.4 Section - Phase 7 Integration Tests
    Validate mandatory observability coverage, metric families, and correlation joinability end-to-end.

    [ ] 7.4.1 Task - Envelope and event-stream integration scenarios
      Verify all critical runtime flows emit required envelope fields and terminal outcomes.

      [ ] 7.4.1.1 Subtask - Verify success/failure/timeout paths emit terminal runtime events.
      [ ] 7.4.1.2 Subtask - Verify missing mandatory envelope fields fail conformance checks.
      [ ] 7.4.1.3 Subtask - Verify denied paths emit typed observability error events.
